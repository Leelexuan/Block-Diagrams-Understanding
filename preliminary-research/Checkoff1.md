# Initial Project Idea

Initially, we considered focusing on table extraction, but given the extensive research already done in that area, we decided to explore applying the latest methods from table extraction to the less-studied domain of diagram extraction, specifically for flowcharts.

# Background 

Flowchart extraction is not heavily explored, nevertheless there can be uses for it such as to make learning materials more accessible to visually-impaired students. 


# How Computer Vision is Relevant

# Research Papers
## Flowchart Knowledge Extraction on Image Processing 

Paper presenting an image processing method to extract text and geometrical shapes from flowchart images, linking components via flow lines, and outputs the extracted information as XML metadata for archiving, knowledge sharing, or further use.

## Towards Automatic Parsing of Structured Visual Content through the Use of Synthetic Data

The paper introduces the Synthetic SVC (SSVC) dataset of 12,000 annotated images while demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness through model evaluation on synthetic and real data.
